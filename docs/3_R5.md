# About R<sup>5</sup>

The R<sup>5</sup> characteristics are 

> five characteristics that a scientific code in computational science should possess: re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable, and replicable.

Although they are tailored to code and software development, these principles can still be very useful applied to other (research) digital objects such as data _per se_ and workflows. 

Readers will find some level of overlap with Open Science and FAIR data principles but should note that the goal is to provide a different perspective on the same problem - namely, how can data maintain value over the long term.
