# About R<sup>5</sup>

The R<sup>5</sup> characteristics are 

> five characteristics that a scientific code in computational science should possess: re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable, and replicable.
> -- Benereau and Rougier (2018)[^1]

Although they are tailored to code and software development. However, these principles can still be very useful applied to other (reasearch) digital objects such as data _per se_ and workflows. Readers will find some level of overlap with Open Science and FAIR data principles. It may therefore help to think of these 

# R<sup>1</sup>: Re-runnable

# R<sup>2</sup>: Repeatable

# R<sup>3</sup>: Reproducible

# R<sup>4</sup>: Reusable

# R<sup>5</sup>: Replicable
