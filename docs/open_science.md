# About research lifecycle
Research is a complex process, and it best understood if broken to phases which are are executed sequentially. There are several representation of research lifecycle, where the most commonly used is one below:

The depicted research lifecycle consists of following phases:
 1. **Hypothesis**

    This the cornerstone phase of research. At this phase of the research lifecycle a researcher establishes a research hypothesis (i.e., a problem statement), selects [research method](https://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/researchmethods) (e.g., [observational study](http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/observationalstudy.html)) which will be used to test/assess the hypothesis and design his/hers research. The design of the research is crucial as it entails details of the phases that will follow, such as a clear design of an experiment/simulation which will be used to test the hypotesis, Data Management Plan ([DMP]((https://dmponline.deic.dk/))) which outlines how data will be collected/processes/published/preserved, etc.

 2. **Data collection**

    At this stage of the research lifecycle a research employs the previously established DMP, thus collecting data either by acquiring already existing datasets ([data re-use](https://nnlm.gov/data/thesaurus/data-reuse)) or creating unexisting datasets (act of data creation).

 3. **Processing**


 4. **Storing data and results**
 5. **Long-term preservation**
 6. **Publication and distribution**
 7. **Reuse**
