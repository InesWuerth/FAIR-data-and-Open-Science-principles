# The FAIR principles

The FAIR principles -- **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperble, and **R**eusable -- guide how we go about the effective and useful storage and dissemination of our data.

> _Data_ means anything that contains some kind of information. One could apply the FAIR principles to anything from a text document to an e-mail to a lidar data set. In general, though, because they are the most valuable type of data (i.e. the hardest to recreate), we usually think of data as meaning a classical data set obtained from a measurement or simulation.

What do they mean in the context of LIKE?

# F - Findable

# A - Accessible

# I - Interoperable

# R - Reusable
