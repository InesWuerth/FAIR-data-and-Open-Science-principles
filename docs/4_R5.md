# About R<sup>5</sup>

Benureau and Rougier in [their work from 2018](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069) defined five characteristics that a scientific code should possess in order to be regarded as a first-class research output. These five characteristics translate into principles that those who write scientific code should follow. In short, a scientific code should be:
1. Re-runnable  (R<sup>1</sup>)
2. Repeatable   (R<sup>2</sup>)
3. Reproducible (R<sup>3</sup>)
4. Reusable     (R<sup>4</sup>)
5. Replicable   (R<sup>5</sup>)

Although these characteristics are tailored to scientific code development, they can still be very useful applied to other (research) digital objects such as data *per se* and workflows.

Readers will find some level of overlap with Open Science and FAIR data principles but should note that the goal is to provide a different perspective on the same problem - namely, how researcg ouputs can maintain value over the long term.

# R<sup>1</sup>: Re-runnable
> The code should be re-runnable (i.e., executable)

# R<sup>2</sup>: Repeatable
> The code should produce the same results every time it is executed

# R<sup>3</sup>: Reproducible
> The code should allow those who use it to reobtain the published results


# R<sup>4</sup>: Reusable
> The code  should be easy to use, understand and modify

# R<sup>5</sup>: Replicable
> A clear an unambiguous algorithmic description of the code should available as a reference allowing the code replication in other programming languages than one chosen for an initial algorithm implementation
