# About Open Science
The following text has been compiled from many sources of which the following where the prime source of information:  Medium article [*What adopting “open science” means for you and your organization*](https://medium.com/@andyclifton_personal/so-you-want-to-implement-open-science-in-an-organisation-d392c2edeb06), FOSTER article [*What is Open Science? Introduction*](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1420) and presentation [*Setting the default to "open" for research*](https://www.en.inside.aau.dk/Events/Event/talk-on-open-science-by-dr.-jon-tennant--setting-the-default-to--open--for-research.cid427260).

Open science can be seen as a new approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools. Those in turn lead to reduced costs by reducing wasted duplicate effort, better visibility of results, and more ability to reuse work elsewhere. It also can reduce reliance on key personnel and makes organizations more resilient. The OECD defines Open Science as approach:  “*to make the primary outputs of publicly funded research results – publications and the research data – publicly accessible in digital format with no or minimal restriction*”. However, as stated by the FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1420) project, Open Science is more than that and it is extending the principles of openness to the whole research lifecycle (see figure 1), fostering sharing and collaboration as early as possible thus entailing a systemic change to the way science and research is done.

Actually 'Open Science' is not a novelty, but according to the [UN declaration](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) it is a (basic) human right (see [Article 27](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)):

1. *Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.*

2. *Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.*

Open Science is frequently defined as an umbrella term that involves various movements aiming to remove the barriers for sharing any kind of output, resources, methods or tools, at any stage of the research process. As such, open access to publications, open research data, open source software, open collaboration, open peer review, open notebooks, open educational resources, open monographs, citizen science, or research crowdfunding, fall into the boundaries of Open Science (see figure 2). Even though, especially for the library and information domain, the focus is usually placed on two of these movements: Open Research Data and Open Access to scientific publications. Before we make a deep dive into each of the Open Science building blocks lets review the current state of science.

Science must be 'open' per se, however pushing and promoting 'Open Science' principles are needed since according to [J. Tennant](https://www.en.inside.aau.dk/Events/Event/talk-on-open-science-by-dr.-jon-tennant--setting-the-default-to--open--for-research.cid427260) there are at least four major crisis:

1. [Access Crisis](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)

    Most scholarly research remains inaccessible to most people on this planet as shown in the figure below:

2. Reproducibility Crisis

    Much research in many fields cannot be sufficiently reproduced.

3. [Serial Crisis](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmbis/99/9905.htm)

    Commercial publishers are basically draining our libraries dry. According to the [report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmbis/99/9905.htm) subscriptions to journals from commercial publishers is not following the consumer price index, but every year it is becoming significantly higher. Elsevier alone, based on the [article](https://medium.com/@jasonschmitt/can-t-disrupt-this-elsevier-and-the-25-2-billion-dollar-a-year-academic-publishing-business-aa3b9618d40a#.py4oxxqyc) from 2015, makes a profit of 25.2 Billion dollar a year from academic publishing business.

4. [Evaluation Crisis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6668985/)

    Globally, Journal Impact Factor (JIF) has been used as a reliable metric to evaluate research articles, their quality. However, JIF was originally designed to aid libraries in deciding which journals to index and purchase for their collections. Therefore, in its structural design JIF is not intended for evaluation of quality of ones work.

As an example lets compare a traditional scientific publishing and one that Open Science principles promote:

As you can see a traditional scientific publishing is more close to an 'advertizement' of one work, while employing 'Open Science' approach you are actually doing science in the right way (basically satisfying many of R5 principles)
