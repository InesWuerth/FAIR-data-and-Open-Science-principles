# Introduction
This report describes how [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1420), [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), and [R^5 ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full) principles can be employed within the [LIKE](https://www.msca-like.eu/) project. 

## Background Reading
We aim at being short, sharp and concise. We use many existing concepts, including:

  1. Open Science terminology and tools established by the [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/about) project.
  2. FAIR data principles definitions established by the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/) initiative. 
  3. R^5 ideas from [Benureau and Rougier (2018)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full).
  
These principles were made to serve the purposes of all research domains. Therefore, this report will focus on tailoring them to the needs of the LIKE [Innovation Training Network](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/get-funding/innovative-training-networks_en) (ITN) of [Early Stage Researchers](http://www.oncornet.eu/index.php/recruitment/2-uncategorised/79-esr) (ESRs).

## A living document
We expect to update this report based on feedback from ITN LIKE and the wider community. We encourage comments, corrections, and other critique as [github issues](https://github.com/LIKE-ITN/FAIR-data-and-Open-Science-principles/issues) because we can use that platform to manage feedback.
