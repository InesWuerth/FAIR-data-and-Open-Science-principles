# Introduction
## About this report
This report describes how [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1420), [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), and [R^5 ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full) principles can be employed within the [LIKE](https://www.msca-like.eu/) project. 

We aim at being short, sharp and concise. We leverage many existing concepts and the reader is encouraged to use those as references. We use the following:

  1. Open Science terminology and tools established by the [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/about) project.
  2. FAIR data principles definitions established by the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/) initiative. 
  3. R^5 ideas from [Benureau and Rougier](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full).
  
As these principles were made to serve the purposes of all research domains, this report will be focused on tailoring their outputs to needs of the LIKE [Innovation Training Network](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/get-funding/innovative-training-networks_en) (ITN) of [Early Stage Researchers](http://www.oncornet.eu/index.php/recruitment/2-uncategorised/79-esr) (ESRs).
