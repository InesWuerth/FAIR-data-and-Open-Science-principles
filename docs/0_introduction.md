# Introduction
## About this report
This report is focused on describing [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1420), [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [R^5](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full) principles and providing examples how these principles can be employed within the [LIKE](https://www.msca-like.eu/) project. When comes to Open Science principles we will use terminology and tools established by the [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/about) project. In case of FAIR data principles we will use definitions established by the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/) initiative. With respect to R^5 we will review work published by [Benureau and Rougier](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full). As all these principles are made to server purposes of all research domains our work in this report will be focused on tailoring their outputs to needs of the LIKE [Innovation Training Network](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/get-funding/innovative-training-networks_en) (ITN) of [Early Stage Researchers](http://www.oncornet.eu/index.php/recruitment/2-uncategorised/79-esr) (ESRs).

## Report structure
We aim at being short, sharp and concise. Therefore, general information about Open Science can be found [here](./open_science.md), while on FAIR data principles use the following [link](./fair_principles.md). In [section](./application_like.md) we will apply these general concepts to the LIKE ITN needs.
