# Introduction
This report describes how [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1420), [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), and [R<sup>5</sup>](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full) principles can be employed within the [LIKE](https://www.msca-like.eu/) project.

## References
We aim to keep this report concise. We will therefore use many existing concepts without going in to extensive detail. The main concepts are:

  1. Open Science terminology and tools established by the [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/about) project.
  2. FAIR data principles and definitions established by the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/) initiative.
  3. R<sup>5</sup> ideas from [Benureau and Rougier (2018)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00069/full).

These principles were made to serve the purposes of all research domains. Therefore, this report will focus on tailoring them to the needs of the LIKE [Innovation Training Network](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/get-funding/innovative-training-networks_en) (ITN) of [Early Stage Researchers](http://www.oncornet.eu/index.php/recruitment/2-uncategorised/79-esr) (ESRs).

## A living document
We expect to update this report based on feedback from ITN LIKE and the wider community. We encourage comments, corrections, and other critique as [github issues](https://github.com/LIKE-ITN/FAIR-data-and-Open-Science-principles/issues) because we can use that platform to manage feedback.
